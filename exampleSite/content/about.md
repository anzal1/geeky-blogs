##### HEY ! IT'S ANZAL HERE,


So,talking about me ,my passion for technology has always been there since childhood any complex looking structures,graphics,games be it minamilistic or too bold have always attracted me ,i've tried to explore every depth of the sea called technology still the deeper i swim the more i get to know that it is acheiving new depths .

Apart from technology i was and i am and i think i would still be equally excited with any kind of sport ,football is one of them .I’ve played football at an honory level and the sight of it ignites the same passion as it did when i first fell in love with it. 

Speaking about my experiences , i am very fortunate to have been a part of an intitution that is sublime in terms of exposure .I’ve taken part in numerous international,national and interstate competions and the variety is insane ,ranging from essay writing to innovation fests ,sports to art fares . I get glimpses of the past as i write this.

Trying to make this short and summarizing about who i am and what all i have lived through,it’s still too less but too much to reveal on an about me section.

Conclusively i haven’t talked about what are my technical skills and abilities cause this isin’t a resume ,rather i shared about how intriguing it can be when you get to know about someone to an extent that you wanna know more ,so feel free to contact and slide ino my dm.
