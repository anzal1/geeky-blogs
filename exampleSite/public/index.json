[{"categories":["artificial intelligence"],"contents":"Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term and describes the broad approach of using machines to imitate intelligent human behavior in order to solve problems.\nMachine Learning is a technology used to achieve Artificial Intelligence. For example, if one were to develop an algorithm to detect fraud in financial data, this would be typical AI. If this algorithm still learns itself and also recognizes new facts, it would be called ML. Deep Learning is the further development of Machine Learning. The technology makes use of so-called neural networks (similar to how the human brain works) or artificial neural networks.\n “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u0026rsquo;re too stupid and they\u0026rsquo;ve already taken over the world.\u0026quot; ― Pedro Domingos\n Tools and conclusive analysis Tools What are the tools like programming languages, services and software you can use for data science? Programming Languages — Famous programming languages are: R Python But also C# and SQL are very common for data science tasks. Services — Here you will find a lot especially in the clouds of the big three like Google, AWS and Azure. Often used services are e.g. image and video recognition, translation, NLP and many more. Software — Here will find also many useful software. Free software like: Anaconda Jupyter Notebook R Studio and also software you have to pay for like: alteryx MS Power BI Tableau Methods Besides certain tools you will also need a data science process. Here, the most famous process to develop AI is the CRISP model.\nCRISP-DM stands for “Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining”. It is a standardized process model that can be used for data mining in order to search data stocks for patterns, trends and correlations. For this purpose, the standard defines six different phases that are to be run through once or several times. The model can be used across many disciplines like data science, business intelligence and engineering . Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning Supervised Learning: Here, the algorithms are defined on the basis of specific examples. An attempt is made to find the solution for other similar problems by generalizing a solution. Supervised learning can be used, for example, to predict customer churn. Popular examples are classifier and regression analysis . Unsupervised Learning: Here, the algorithms are processed with arbitrary examples. The goal here is to identify a structure within the data set. The most important method is clustering.\nReinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning or reinforcement learning stands for a set of machine learning methods in which an agent autonomously learns a strategy to maximize rewards received. One of the most famous algorithm as an examples is the Monte Carlo algorithm. Conclusion This is in short what you have to know about Artificial Intelligence. To dive deeper you can use the sources below or just google a bit. Famous platforms to start learning and gaining certificates are for example Udemy, Data Camp or Udacity.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-1_hu9af054623b436d0bd3986b31b7bc6cd9_4158512_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-1/","title":"Artificial Intelligence and Robotics In A Nutshell"},{"categories":["drone"],"contents":"Drones allow opening previously unavailable opportunities – to see the invisible and reach the unreachable – not only in the air but also on the ground and underwater. Drawing on our 32-year experience in software development, we discover drone software architecture, discuss a basic and extended set of features for modern drone apps, and give an overview of trends that are likely to shape the future of drone software development.\n “Our greatest power as nations and individuals is not the ability to employ assault weapons, suicide bombers, and drones to destroy each other. The greater more creative powers with which we may arm ourselves are grace and compassion sufficient enough to love and save each other.” ― Aberjhani, Splendid Literarium: A Treasury of Stories, Aphorisms, Poems, and Essays\n Industries where drones are used Modern drones are not only about thrilling aerial footages. Drones are gaining popularity across all kinds of markets. By the year 2022, the commercial drone market is expected to reach $10,738 million. According to Goldman Sachs, the fastest adopters of drone techs will be such industries as:\nConstruction: Surveying buildings; creating contour maps; building roads and railways; counting construction supplies.\nAgriculture: Monitoring plants and livestock; monitoring water use; spraying crops.\nInsurance: Damage inspection; risk assessment; fraud monitoring.\nOil \u0026amp; gas: Laying and monitoring oils \u0026amp; gas pipelines.\nDrones are also actively conquering such spheres as: Scientific surveillance: Exploring the ground of archaeological sites, radiation zones, and the deep sea; monitoring wildlife; terrain modeling.\nDisaster management: Monitoring areas affected by natural disasters. Informing search and rescue teams about the damage; supplying blood, emergency aids and equipment; fighting fire.\nLogistics: Checking inventory; delivering packages (works in combination with barcode scanning).\nEnergy: Inspecting solar farms and power lines.\nSecurity: Monitoring state boundaries; ensuring security during public events.\nOverview of a sample drone software architecture drone software architecture\nDrone software includes several parts: system software, user software, and a cloud-based control platform.\nSystem software encompasses the following components: Embedded software operates as CPU – manages hardware, tracks drone telemetry and partially analyzes the data received from drone sensors (GPS, thermal sensors, infrared and lidar cameras, ultrasonic and vision sensors and more). OS allows users to operate the firmware part. Web and cloud interfaces allow accessing the OS from remote drone control systems (user applications and cloud control stations) and streaming gathered data from embedded software to the cloud or mobile devices. A cloud-based drone control platform is used for data processing, storage and analysis. It also enables a drone’s autonomous response actions. The cloud part is a must when it comes to complex processes as in, say, 3D maps creation, computer vision, pattern recognition.\nThe cloud-based control platform hosts: Streaming data processor. Data lake and big data warehouse. Data analytics and machine learning. Drone control module. Interfaces to communicate with the drone. User software covers front- and back-end parts of web and mobile user applications. They help users to plan and conduct flights, as well as display data from a drone to users. User software also includes interfaces for communication with the cloud and the drone.\nTo communicate with each other, the three parts use special protocols, for example, MAVlink and ROSlink.\nHighlights in modern-day drone application development To make a successful and long-lasting drone application, we suggest paying attention to the following development aspects:\nFeatures for safe and convenient work The basic feature set of drone applications should include:\nSimulating training flights and controlling real flights. Checking weather conditions and forecasting weather in the flying region. Planning routes (taking into consideration ‘no-fly’ maps and info about critical infrastructure, transport and pedestrian ways, privacy zones). Transmitting to the smartphone what a drone sees or the already processed data from the cloud (audio/video streaming). User applications can offer extended functionality depending on what the drone is used for. Among the most utilized capabilities of modern drone user apps are:\nProfessional photography and film editing. Video and image sharing. Chat capabilities. Alerts on the drone condition, route modifications, obstacles in the way. 3D modeling and exporting into the needed format. Other important considerations Software certification Drone software is subject to such standards as DO-178C and ISO 14508, so the software architecture, requirements gathering, coding and integration processes, reviews and testing, configuration management should be organized accordingly.\nExceptional data security Drones are often a target of hacker attacks. Thus, exceptional attention should be given to ensuring data security, especially when it comes to drones’ usage for government or military purposes. The required level of protection for the software part can be provided through such measures as ensuring a safe connection between software parts, isolating confidential parts at the architectural level, strong encryption and authentication.\nContinuous enhancements If you want to keep up with the rapidly evolving innovations in the drone industry, enhancements should happen frequently and not hinder the system’s stability. One of the latest and most popular approaches to assert the software quality in the context of fast development is to use the continuous development, delivery and deployment approach. The approach implies the usage of containers, shared code repository, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach and other DevOps practices, automation in test (unit, API, UI) preparation and execution, sound versioning and more.\nDesign that allows for scalability To stay competitive, drone software should be ready for both increasing the number of users and data, and new features and deep customizations. A good way to address these needs is organizing the drone applications’ architecture in a modular pattern (for example, based on the service-oriented model or microservices).\nIntegration with other systems Enterprise drone applications should be able to integrate with enterprise systems, depending on their task – for example, with logistics management systems for delivery services, maintenance systems for pipeline surveying and so on.\nSimple UI in user apps UI should make drone controlling easy for people from different spheres and of different roles. It means that a user app should be intuitive in guiding a drone operator through the flying process and accurate in conveying the analytics results.\nWhat does the market expect from drones in the near future The main efforts in drone software development will be focused on the enablement of more advanced autonomous capabilities. They will derive from:\nAbility to perform AI-driven route planning and mid-course corrections (in case of weather or wind changes). It will require refinement of AI algorithms for better autonomous trajectory creation. To safely navigate around obstacles and avoid collisions, algorithms for both co-piloting and fully autonomous flights of drones have already been developed. But they still require further improvement. Real-time monitoring and coordination. The use of real-time operating systems (RTOS) is gaining popularity as a way to make drones capable of quicker data processing and accurate responding. RTOS multi-threading allows a drone to promptly combine and process real-time data about people, buildings, other drones, manned aircrafts that are in close proximity. In addition, it enables RTOS to accurately trigger follow-up actions, quickly assess the priority of tasks and schedule actions accordingly. In addition, priority will be given to improving data collection and analysis. Users require more and more sophisticated pattern recognition for enhanced 3D modelling, image processing and analysis, deep learning and other intelligent capabilities that are in direct correlation with modern enterprise drone usages.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-8_hu04189c2e0facd57b1df05828893c5294_760067_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-8/","title":"Drone Software and Development"},{"categories":["github"],"contents":"Github Tutorial: How to Make Your First GitHub Repository\nA critical skill for developers of all experience levels is proficiency in GitHub. Github is a hosting platform for Git repositories that acts as a central location to store and manage code. GitHub is a popular choice for developers and their teams because it offers version control, collaboration capabilities, and a community of peers sharing their trials and successes in software engineering.\nIn this article, we’ll complete a tutorial on creating your first GitHub repository. First, let’s start with a closer look at the GitHub ecosystem and why I recommend students of my Web Developer Bootcamp course and all software developers take the time to understand this valuable tool.\n Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nemo vel ad consectetur ut aperiam. Itaque eligendi natus aperiam? Excepturi repellendus consequatur quibusdam optio expedita praesentium est adipisci dolorem ut eius!\n GitHub vs. Git They may have similar names, but GitHub is not synonymous with Git. Some developers work with Git and never use GitHub.\nWhat’s Git? It’s an open-source version control management system that tracks changes to projects. Version control software records and manages every change made to source code and files. Git is a type of version control system for developers and teams to manage and collaborate on versions of code, which are stored in project repositories as it moves through the development life cycle.\nGit can be used on its own without GitHub or other similar platforms, but it’s difficult to collaborate and share code with coworkers or the developer community without a platform like GitHub.\nHow does GitHub compare to Git? GitHub is a web platform that hosts Git repositories. Think of GitHub as a project viewer to share different code versions and access remote repositories. Each repository contains all project files and the code history. Repositories contain all project files, code history, and can have multiple collaborators.\nDevelopers clone (download) a repository to their computer and work on a local version of the project. After working on code or developing new features on a local computer, developers push the changes to the same GitHub repository. Then, other developers or team members can download the version to their computer and stay synced with the project’s development.\n5 GitHub benefits for developers We know how GitHub differs from Git, but why should developers take the time to learn and use it? There are several benefits that I share with students on why they should use GitHub:\nCollaboration — Collaboration with the developer community is one of GitHub’s most common uses, and it’s also one of its biggest benefits. It’s a way for teammates to work together and provide feedback. GitHub is also an ideal way for open-source projects to see continued collaboration from individual developers. In fact, GitHub is the largest open-source code repository on the internet! Version control and backup — Git is the version control software, while GitHub is the platform where projects using Git are stored and accessed. Essentially, GitHub acts as the cloud backup to a software project. Project management — GitHub can be used as a technical project management tool to track issues and bugs. This helps projects stay on schedule throughout the software development life cycle. Developer portfolio — GitHub offers a free web hosting service called GitHub Pages. It’s a straightforward way to turn a GitHub repository into an easy-to-review portfolio website. Networking — GitHub is a bit like a social networking website for developers. Users can follow each other, give project ratings, collaborate, communicate, and meet other developers from around the world. How to create a GitHub repository Now that you know the why of GitHub, I’ll get you started on the platform with this tutorial on creating your first repository. We’ll start by creating a local project to demonstrate how to upload it to GitHub.\nStep 1: Create a new local Git repository Open up your terminal and navigate to your projects folder, then run the following command to create a new project folder and navigate into it:\nmkdir hello-world cd hello-world To initialize a new local Git repository we need to run the git init command:\ngit init After you run that command, you should get feedback that an empty Git repository was initialized for your project.\nStep 2: Adding a new file to our Git repository Create a new file in your project folder, we will call our sample file hello.js\nYou can use the graphical interface of your operating system to create the file, or use the following terminal commands:\nWindows Powershell: ni hello.js Bash (Mac/Linux) terminal: touch hello.js\nYou can open the hello.js file with your text editor, and write the following JavaScript code which prints Hello World! to the console:\nconsole.log(\u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026quot;);\nSave the file changes and switch back to your terminal window. Note: Make sure to use the git status command frequently when working with Git. It’s a great way to check the status of your project files and the whole repository.\nStep 3: Making our initial commit to the local repository Run the following commands to track your files and make the initial commit in the local repository:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026ldquo;Initial commit\u0026rdquo; When that’s done, it means that we successfully prepared our new local repository to be pushed to GitHub!\nStep 4: Creating a new GitHub repository To create a new GitHub repository, navigate to github.com and press the plus symbol in the top right corner, then select the ‘New repository‘ option, as shown in the screenshot here:\nYou can also navigate to the GitHub page for creating new repositories by visiting this link: https://github.com/new\nOn that page, we first need to specify a Repository name and an optional Description.\nFor the Repository name, we can specify the same project name (hello-world) as the local repository that we are using in our example. If you want, you can also write a Description of your repository, but you can also skip that field as we did in the screenshot above.\nYou can set your repository to be Public or Private. When uploading your code to a public directory, make sure it doesn’t contain any sensitive data not intended to share with others. When creating a Private repository, you’ll manually choose who can access the new repository.\nStep 5: Pushing our code to the GitHub repository After the last step, you’ll be sent to the starting page of your new GitHub repository, which looks like this:\nSince we’ve already created our Git repo locally, we’ll focus on the “…or push an existing repository from the command line” section of the page.\n(Note: If we didn’t already have a local repository created, then we would follow the first set of commands to create a local repository from the remote GitHub one that was just created.)\nThe git remote add origin command will associate our local repository with the remote GitHub repository that we just created. We’re essentially telling your Git repo that we have a URL we want it to know about, and we give it the name “origin.” You do not have to name the remote “origin” but it is standard if you only have a single remote.\nThe git push command then pushes our local Git repository code to the remote GitHub repository.\nNow, switch back to your local terminal and run the specified commands from your project folder:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com//.gitgit push -u origin master\nWhen you run the git push command you’ll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password, to log in to your GitHub account from the terminal.\nAfter the repository is pushed, navigate back to your GitHub account page or the repository link and refresh it: https://github.com//\nNow, you can use that link to share your project repository with other people!\nAnyone can click on the hello.js file to see the contents of our project files. Also, other developers can clone or download the remote repository to their local computer by clicking on the green button highlighted in the screenshot. Other data, including past commits, existing branches, etc. will be visible from the repository.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-4_hu4a740c48d1f2b077319265deb994d549_1981244_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-4/","title":"Github Repository Controls"},{"categories":["workstation"],"contents":"The Pros and Cons of Working from Home as a Web Developer The US Occupational Outlook Handbook estimates that by 2024, there will be a 27% increase in the job prospects for this kind of expertise, due to the increasing use of mobile devices and e-commerce.\nMany web developers are also able to work from home, which makes it an attractive career option for some.\nSome Web developers have a degree (2 or 4 year-programs) and certifications in web development. But above all, successful developers have a deep desire to learn constantly, whether its graphic design, programming, scripting and markup languages (HTML 5, CSS, Javascript or XML), or other areas.\nBecoming a freelance web developer or telecommuting has several advantages. Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss some of them.\n “ Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House\n Advantages and Disadvantages of working from home. Advantage #1. Freedom to Set your Own Hours The main advantage of working from home is the flexibility to work when and where you want. If you are already established web developer, you can decide how many hours you would typically spend on a project each day and then pace it based on your schedule.\nNote that if you are just starting a career as a freelancer, you might have clients calling on you at odd hours of the day or night. In this case, you need to be flexible to accommodate their needs especially if you are still building your portfolio and reputation in the freelancing world.\nAdvantage #2. Increased Productivity Website building requires long hours and working without the distraction of an office or co-workers can increase the time you devote to creating, improving, or tweaking the site. In effect, telecommuters are more productive as they put in extra hours and are less likely to take extended breaks or days off even when ill.\nAdvantage #3. Ability to Balance Work and Home Life Part of the attraction of teleworking is that you can juggle your career and personal life at the same time. Since you set your own hours, you can devote time to spend with loved ones, friends, family and even pets. You are likely to feel happier and less stressed out knowing that you still manage to spend quality time with them while getting work done. You can even save on childcare and pet sitting costs since you are at home. People who work from home are also twice as likely to love their jobs than on-site workers (Leadership IQ Survey, 2016).\nAdvantage #4. No Dress Codes and Stressful Commutes Working at home does not require a dress code which can save you a bundle in shopping and dry-cleaning costs. In addition, there are no nerve-wracking commutes that can affect you physically and mentally. You might have the occasional face-to-face meeting with a client, but these days, with the reliability of tele and videoconferences, there is hardly a need to meet in person unless you must do on-site work.\nDisadvantage #1. Discipline Having no set schedule might make you slack off in many ways such as putting off that web design project you have planned in favor of playing outdoors with the kids. Hence, telecommuting requires sheer discipline to ensure you follow the schedule you make and don\u0026rsquo;t succumb to distractions.\nDisadvantage #2. Absence of External Pressures It is too easy to do anything you want when you are alone and no one is watching you which can make productivity levels plummet drastically. To avoid this, make a daily or weekly plan and stick to it.\nDisadvantage #3. Limited Social Life and Contacts You might feel isolated and left out when you are in the company of Fido all day long. Social contact and relationships are harder to form when you are home all day long. To remedy this, join networking clubs, get in touch with colleagues or volunteer some free time in community projects.\nDisadvantage #4. Overworking and Work Burnout Perhaps most importantly, is the danger of becoming overworked at home. It is all too easy to work at odd hours due to client demands or sales deadlines you have to meet.\nConclusion Web development instinctively lends itself to quiet and focused environments, so working at home is a natural choice. It would be wrong to say there are not many things to consider but in most instances, web developers will reap many rewards when they make the decision to work from home. Or at least work remotely for some of the business week. It is not for everyone but there is definitely money to be made in developing from home.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-5_huc6f88ff51df690e7373477f242319dec_941788_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-5/","title":"My work from home workstation"},{"categories":["robotics"],"contents":"“A robot is an autonomous machine capable of sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and performing actions in the real world.” —Source: What Is a Robot? – ROBOTS: Your Guide to the World of Robotics\nRobots have frequently been depicted or described in works of fiction. The word “robot” itself comes from a work of fiction, Karel Čapek‘s play, R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), written in 1920, the concept has developed in the human imagination long back. We are now at the cusp of a revolution through which robots will give us complete freedom from laborious, mundane tasks such as cleaning, cooking, or even taking care of our kids on the days you aren’t feeling up for it.\n “Let’s start with the three fundamental Rules of Robotics…. We have: one, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.” ~Isaac Asimov.\n What is Robotics? A robot is an automatic mechanical device guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry which enables it to perform tasks assigned to it. It is a system that contains sensors, control systems, manipulators, power supplies and software, all of which work together.\nRobotics is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition.\nRobotics is design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment. It basically involves the concept of Programming, Mathematics, Design, Electronics and much more. It can be summarized as the mixture of all sort of engineering you can name (except a few). But if you are designing a robot for some specific application, you might need to study that particular branch too.\nScope of Robotic Engineering Robotics engineers, like any other professions in the engineering discipline, will need to be strong in math and sciences. However, most people think that engineers are just whizzes at math and science from the get-go, but that’s rarely ever the case. For most engineers, at least the ones that complete their degrees, they aren’t the people that are best at math naturally, they’re the ones that stuck it out and put in the hard work.\nThis field has a vast range of job opportunities for the aspiring candidates.”\nAfter completing the degree/diploma or vocational course in this field, you can take jobs in manufacturing, maintenance, research of nuclear power plants and many other areas. Due to the advancement of technology, this robotics technology is used in space exploration, power plant maintenance, automobile industry, Petroleum exploring places, etc.\nPlenty of job opportunities are available for robotics engineers both in India as well as in abroad countries. Candidates with M.Tech degree in Robotics can seek job opportunities in space research organizations such as ISRO and also in industries which manufacture microchips.\nThey can work in robot manufacturers. Robot engineers working for robot manufacturers are sometimes called robotics test engineers or automation system engineers.\nElectronics engineers turned robotics engineers will be more adept at the coding and electronics facets of robots. Mechanical engineers will be more adept at the mechanical function and design of robotic machines.\nJob Titles: Robotics Programmers Robotics Technicians Robot Design Engineer Robotics Test Engineers Senior Robotics Specialist Automated Product Design Engineer Agricultural Instrumentation Engineer Robotics System Engineer Robotics Testers Maintenance Engineers Future Aspects A course in robotics trains and educates a student in the field of artificial intelligence, computer-aided manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing system, computational geometry, robot motion planning, digital electronics and micro processing. Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing industries. As the industries increases, scope for robotics also increases. Robots are mainly used for carrying materials including heavy parts to and from inconvenient locations and handling hazardous materials like nuclear waste.\nEngineers, who have interest in Robots have bright future. Around 2040, Robots will become part of our life. As today we use our smart phones and laptops, we will use robots (of course for some big and intelligent tasks). As robots will become major part of life, study of them will also very popular.\nPursuing Robotic Engineering in India The industrial robotics has opened up of several career avenues in India in engineering design, development, research and management. It makes available wide range of entrepreneurial opportunities as well. With combined efforts of the Government, the industrial sector and various training institutes, industrial robotics can grow in India with leaps and bounds and catapult the nation into a fast paid journey of unprecedented progress and development.\nThe best Engineering institutes in Delhi NCR are coming up with the courses on Robotics. Entrepreneurship oriented Skill development courses have been initiated by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) Ministry of HRD, Government of India to promote “Make in India initiative”. These courses will be run by AICTE approved institutes, where apart from technical teaching, trained resources will extensively hand hold students and impart specific skills, making them self-reliant to initiate their own start-ups.\nBachelor of Vocation (B. Voc.) is gaining importance as demand for skill based education is need of the hour. Today’s industry is looking for resources that are ready to deliver from day one of joining. A course in Robotics assures 100 percent placement in top industries of the country in top industries of the country. “There are an endless number of things to discover about robotics. A lot of it is just too fantastic for people to believe.” Daniel H.

A virtual assistant is a virtual employee hired as an executive or administrative assistant for your business who works remotely.\nIn other words, a virtual assistant takes on recurring, repetitive, and administrative work to free up other employees’ time within the company.\nA virtual assistant may work for a small business in tandem with a business owner to take tasks off their plate. In a larger company, such as a call or contact center, a virtual administrative assistant may work on duties to free up time for customer support representatives.\n “If you don’t know what your passion is, realize that one reason for your existence on earth is to find it.” – Oprah Winfrey, Entrepreneur, Producer, and Philanthropist.\n What to add to a virtual assistant job description? Now that you understand what a virtual assistant is, let’s go over a few of the possible virtual assistant duties they can undertake to help you and your company.\n1. Social media management Virtual assistant tasks – social media management Since managing social media is inherently an online task, handing off your company’s social media profiles to your virtual assistant is one way to free up time for yourself or other employees.\nA virtual assistant can monitor activity and engagement metrics on each social media platform your business is on and make sure to keep each channel active. Whether that includes a daily post or a Story update, keeping social platforms active and up-to-date is a perfect virtual assistant task. Virtual assistants can also take on the management of social media customer service.\nIf your virtual assistant skills include social media management, you can also assign them to develop a social media strategy and schedule activities in advance.\n2. Blog management and content production One of virtual assistant duties – writing a blog post Got a blog? A virtual administrative assistant can be a lifesaver. Tasks like planning and organizing an editorial calendar, editing, formatting, and publishing content – all that can be managed by your assistant even if they don’t have a background in producing content as such. A helping hand with administrative tasks in managing your company’s blog can significantly benefit your day-to-day workflow.\nAnother virtual assistant task idea includes reviewing the drafted content. About to hire a virtual assistant with some background in content creation and excellent language skills? Maybe they can be an occasional help with proofreading the writing when your team’s hands are full with other duties.\n3. Email management Inbox opened on a smart phone If you’re managing a company or you’re in charge of a team, there’s no doubt you have an oversaturated inbox.\nManaging your emails–labeling them by type, responding to simple questions, and escalating time-sensitive issues–is something a virtual assistant can do with ease and little to no supervision. By delegating this task, you’ll get back essential hours in your workweek instead of spending your evenings combing through emails.\n4. Customer service Virtual assistant working for customer support Another possible responsibility for virtual assistants is customer service and support.\nWhether you need a live support specialist to answer and resolve real-time support tickets or someone who responds to less urgent tickets at a slower pace, this is a task you can delegate to a virtual assistant.\nGetting back to customer requests can take up quite a lot of time, even if you’re an owner of a small business. Have your virtual assistant field calls, support requests, order processing, and anything support-related you need help with, and you’ll have more time to spend on other duties.\n5. Financial tasks Financing Virtual assistants can also deal with financial matters. Since they can either be generalists or specialists, you can hire a finance-specific specialist, like a CPA, for daily financial tasks.\nIn this case, a virtual assistant’s tasks can include data entry and invoice creation or something more complex, like recording transactions and helping with bookkeeping duties. Whether you hire a data entry virtual assistant or a person skilled in financial matters – remember, you don’t have to deal with everything alone, and there are people happy to provide help and assistance as their professional occupation.\nWhen to hire a virtual assistant? Question mark If you’re in a managing position, you may have a line of time-consuming and repetitive tasks that steal work hours, which should be devoted to, for example, building strategy or meeting new clients.\nThings that can fall into the category of such tasks include sending emails, making phone calls, creating lists, organizing files, scheduling meetings, preparing slide decks, developing content, and so much more.\nEven if you’re a superhero with a crazy working capacity, it’s in your best interest to evaluate whether there are some duties you could entrust to someone else. Why be constantly tired and overwhelmed from the amount of work when you can hire a virtual assistant instead?\nLet’s explore how to train a virtual assistant so they can take some of the work off your shoulders and benefit your business growth.\nHow to train your virtual personal assistant? Training a virtual assistant might seem daunting when they’re far away. Still, with the global acceleration of remote work in 2020, it’s become a lot easier and more commonplace to train employees at a distance.\nBeyond smooth onboarding processes and proper written documentation, it’s essential to use tools that make the training process a breeze.\nIt’s a good idea to use project management tools, like a shared calendar or a digital vision board, to house all of your team’s projects, with one section specific to your virtual assistant.\nWe’ve compiled seven easy-to-follow tips for training a virtual assistant that will make the process as seamless as it can be.\n1. Set the right expectations Running hurdles Before dumping a ton of work on your new virtual assistant, you need to have a strong foundation in place. If they, for example, live in a different time zone than you, make sure you establish working hours across time zones and what is considered “off-hours”.\nOnce you set those expectations, create an outline of weekly objectives and longer-term goals. You’re likely bringing on a virtual assistant to make your life or the lives of multiple employees easier, so it’s your job to equip them with the right tools and set expectations from the get-go.\nTo reiterate, do the following:\nClarify working and off-hours. Provide weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual objectives and expectations. Figure out how you want to track their working hours, especially those that are asynchronous – a time tracking tool is an obvious way to do this.\n2. Provide adequate training materials You want to ease your virtual assistant into daily operations. Providing high-quality training materials like videos, screenshots, written documentation, and more is a great way to get your virtual assistant up and running comfortably.\nCreate a convenient information hub that contains the most critical deadlines, tools, people to contact on the team, and other resources your virtual assistant needs to be successful in their role.\nPlus, ask which communication style your virtual assistant prefers. For example, some people go for emails, others – team chat or phone. Whatever your virtual assistant’s choice of communication is, use that primarily to ease their training process. Additionally, remember to integrate them into the team’s communication, so your virtual assistant is up-to-speed with the latest information.\n3. Use videos and screencasts Filming training video Using video is a great way to show and tell how to do more complex business tasks. Apps like CloudApp, Loom, and Vimeo have inexpensive options to record and share processes on your screen.\nYou can then compile these videos and screencasts in a repository and send them to your virtual assistant during the training process. Such content is an excellent alternative to long-winded powerpoints and screenshots with confusing jargon. However, if you must use screenshots, keep the number to a minimum, and provide context, supplemental notes, and instructions where applicable.\n4. Communicate effectively One of the most challenging tasks when training and working with a virtual assistant is staying on the same page. For example, if your virtual assistant lives in a timezone three hours away, this could create a divide if you don’t have a collaboration and communication plan in place.\nAccording to statistics, 83% of companies lost a customer, missed an important deadline, or terminated an employee due to a communication issue in 2019.\nOne way to stay on top of communication is through regular email updates. You can send and receive daily updates to keep each other accountable on tasks. However, if your virtual assistant has lots of emails filling their inbox, this could pose a communication issue.\n5. Exploit project management tools Set of tools Using a cloud-based project management tool is essential when training your virtual assistant. These tools make it easier to collaborate, especially when working on the same documents together. A typical example of this would be you and your virtual assistant working on a slideshow simultaneously.\nEven longer-term project planning can be made more accessible through a work board like Asana or Trello. But if you’re interested in the most accessible option on a tighter budget, something like Google Drive may also work for your business needs.\n6. Build a resource center Once you’ve created your training documents, step-by-step guides, explainer videos, screencasts, and slide decks for training, collate all your training material into a single repository. This way, you won’t have to create multiple versions of the same documents.\nPro tip: If you’re looking to take it a step further, a learning management system is a great way to centralize your training resources.\nEvery time you create a new set of instructions, add them to the directory. This will be your master list you can work with and revamp as time goes on. For extra value, include both marketing and sales playbooks to give additional references depending on the type of work you assign to your virtual assistant.\n7. Present feedback, constructive criticism, and praise Feedback print While you can’t be in the same physical location as your virtual assistant, this doesn’t mean you can neglect to treat them as you would an in-office employee.\nEnsure that you’re offering ample feedback and constructive criticism on their work, especially in areas that need improvement.\nIf your virtual assistant isn’t doing the job right, explain what you need them to change to be at their best. But if they are excelling, be sure to let them know that too. Lack of performance recognition, on average, drives 44% of employees to look for other jobs. Can you afford to lose a high-performing virtual assistant to another company?\nFinal thoughts on finding a virtual assistant All in all, hiring a virtual assistant is probably one of the most sensible business decisions you can make this year, especially with remote work continuously on the rise.\nWhether you’re a smaller business that could use some extra brain-power or a large enterprise that can no longer spare time for a set of particular tasks, hiring a virtual assistant is a great choice to make. With both niche specialists and generalists galore, you can have your pick of the virtual assistant right for your team’s needs.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-3_hu4cc21e7a863615a92cd0655f577c12f3_800270_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-3/","title":"What is a Virtual Assistant"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"What is Programming?\nWe all have heard about Computer Programming gaining a lot of popularity in the past 3 decades. So many students these days want to opt for a Computer Science stream in order to get a job at their dream tech company - Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and whatnot.\nWhat is Programming? In this blog post, we will decipher the term “programming” and understand its usage and many other related terms.\nUnderstanding Programming in layman terms Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.\nConfusing? Let us understand the definition deeply.\n “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” – Martin Fowler\n Brief intro to what coding actually is “Instruct the computer”: this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instructions could be of various types. For example:\nAdding 2 numbers, Rounding off a number, etc. Just like we humans can understand a few languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, etc.), so is the case with computers. Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language.\n“Perform various tasks”: the tasks could be simple ones like we discussed above (adding 2 numbers, rounding off a number) or complex ones which may involve a sequence of multiple instructions. For example:\nCalculating simple interest, given principal, rate and time. Calculating the average return on a stock over the last 5 years. The above 2 tasks require complex calculations. They cannot usually be expressed in simple instructions like adding 2 numbers, etc.\nHence, in summary, Programming is a way to tell computers to do a specific task.\nWhy should you bother about coding? You must be wondering - why does one need a computer for adding or rounding off numbers? Or even for simple interest calculation? After all, even an 8th standard kid can easily do such things even over large numbers. What is programming used for? What benefits do computers offer?\nWell, computers offer so many benefits:\nComputers are fast: computers are amazingly fast. If you know how to properly utilize the power of Computer programming, you can do wonders with it. For a typical computer of today’s time, an addition of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each takes hardly a nanosecond. Read again - nanosecond! That means that in 1 second, a computer can perform about a billion additions. Can any human ever do that? Forget a billion additions a second, typical human can’t even do 10 additions per second. So, computers offer great speed. Computers are cheap: if you were a stock market analyst and you had to monitor the data of say 1000 stocks so that you can quickly trade them. Imagine the hassle that would create if you were to do it manually! It is just impractical. While you are performing your calculation on the stock’s performance, the price may change. The other alternative is to hire people so that you can monitor more stocks in parallel. That means your cost goes up significantly. Not to mention the trouble you will face if some of your employees commit a calculation error in the process. You may end up losing money! Contrast that with the case where you use a computer. Computers can process a huge amount of information quickly and reliably. 1000 stocks are nothing for computers in the 21st century. Computers can work 24x7: Computers can work 24x7 without getting exhausted. So, if you have a task that is big enough, you can without worries allocate it to a computer by programming it and sleep peacefully. What is Programming Language? As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our another blog-post \u0026ldquo;What is programming language?\u0026rdquo; to know more about programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are Python, C, C++, Java, etc.\nWhy should you learn Computer Programming? Now, after knowing so many things about programming, the big question to be answered is - why should you learn Computer Programming? Let us understand why:\nProgramming is fun: Using Programming, you can create your own games, your personal blog/profile page, a social networking site like Facebook, a search engine like Google or an e-commerce platform like Amazon! Won’t that be fun? Imagine creating your own game and putting it on Play Store and getting thousands and thousands of downloads! The backbone of a Technology Company: The backbones of today’s technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and many others, are giant computer programs written by a collaboration of thousands of skilled programmers. If you have the right business acumen, knowing programming can help you create the next big tech company. Pretty good salary: Computer Programmers are paid extremely well almost all across the world. Top programmers in Silicon Valley make millions of dollars every year. Quite a few companies offer to start salaries as high as $100,000 per year. Let us now get into an actual program\nWriting your first program Python is a widely-used programming language. It is extremely beginner-friendly. You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. After downloading, run the installer in order to install Python on your machine.\nLet us delve into our first Python code now. Open your favorite text editor (we’d recommend Sublime Text) and copy-paste the following 3 lines:\na = 54 b = a ** 8 print b Save the file on your desktop as my_first_program.py\nNow, do one of the following depending on your operating system:\nWindows: open command prompt and type python my_first_program.py Ubuntu/Mac OSX: open terminal and type python my_first_program.py When you press enter, what do you see on the screen? Almost instantly after you press the enter key, you will see the following:\nWhat’s that? That’s 548, computed by your computer in the blink of an eye! A typical human will take minutes if not seconds to get the result. You see the power of a Computer?\nCongratulations, you’ve written your first program. Let us understand how it works.\na = 54 We are declaring here that we have a “placeholder” called as a to which we assign the value 54.\nb = a ** 8 Here, we are declaring another placeholder called as b to which we assign the value a ** 8. Here, the value of a is 54. So, effectively we are computing 54 ** 8. What is **? The ** operator is the “power” operator. a ** b means ab.\nprint b Finally, after the computation is done, we want to display the result on the screen. For this, we have used the print statement which essentially throws the result on your screen.\nSo, that was about the very basics of Computer programming. Hope you enjoyed reading it. Computer Programming is a huge field and there is a lot to explore further. Keep learning and keep exploring. Please feel free to post your doubts in the comments section. Please don’t worry if you feel that your doubt is maybe silly. Every question/doubt is important. There\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question.\n","date":"November 17, 2021","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/post/post-2_hued73e14e63118e19fad39e39968d7cc7_2441315_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/blog/post-2/","title":"What you need to know about Programming"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":"PHP is a popular programming language which is utilized to build dynamic web applications with MySQL database connections.

IT\u0026rsquo;S ANZAL HERE, My fascination with technology was sparked when, as a child I thought it would be a great idea to take apart my Playstation console. Aware of the danger, I was still eager to see how it all worked inside. I find it intriguing how fast society has been shaped and continues to be, by the influence of Computer Science. A few years ago if someone were to have claimed that cars would become autonomous, people would have doubted them. Now we are at a stage where nearly anything is possible and this is due to the relentless problem solving of computer scientists. The latest software update released by Tesla motors allows their cars to learn how to drive themselves, and is an example of artificial intelligence, a sector which I am most interested in. I want to study Computer Science because I want to gain the knowledge needed to be able to help find solutions to world problems, with the efficient use of computer technology. With the knowledge and skills, I will attain from this course, the creative ideas that I could bring into fruition would be endless. I hope to become one of the computer scientists who adapt technology to help the human race evolve. One possibility would be for artificially intelligent gadgets to recognise different people and adjust to their individual needs based on personal preferences. I have been teaching myself Objective-C syntax in my spare time and have completed online programming courses, which have allowed me to explore the endless possibilities that computer science can bring to the world. I have also learnt to create a simple iOS game using Apple’s syntax called ‘Swift’, in XCode alongside Photoshop.\nI understand that computer science is not just about programming and hardware but also about the ethics entailed in the process of a design as well as innovative thinking. Studying A-Level Philosophy and Ethics has given me an insight into many ethical situations that may arise around computer science such as the creation of artificial intelligence. This raises controversy of whether or not we should be trying to create artificial intelligence, as people have different beliefs and faiths. One example of such controversy was during the development of Honda’s Asimo robot when engineers had to visit the Vatican to seek permission to continue the project due to how human-like the robot was developed to walk. During a week of volunteering on NCS I visited Wazoku, the creators of an idea-sharing software used by major corporations such as Waitrose and The BBC. I was given an insight into the working environment that I hope to join after completing my degree. I am applying for work experience at Wazoku, in order to learn about how the software industry can influence the progress of companies.\nI am constantly seeking to learn new skills and gain experience from various activities. I have been a member of the RAF Air Cadets for four years, where I have learnt many valuable life skills such as discipline, leadership, charity and confidence. Alongside these life skills I have gained various qualifications such as The St. John’s Ambulance Youth First Aid qualification and Leading Cadet qualification. Being a cadet also involved doing charity work such as raising money for the RAF Benevolence Fund and the Poppy Appeal. Through all these experiences I have learnt how to work with people from all walks of life, different backgrounds and people who have different beliefs and ideas to the ones I do. This has enabled me to adjust my approach to solving different problems and situations.\nTechnological advancements take place around us everyday, from the evolution of bulky antenna phones into smart phones to the introduction of smart virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Google Now and Windows’ Cortana. I am inspired by the fact that computer science has become a fundamental element in the development of a better, smarter future for our world and my goal is to be part of that development process.\nWANNA KNOW MORE ABOUT ME , click here ","date":"January 1, 1","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/author_hude9b0fa4ed50c41f999680b14b704cd9_1107719_650x0_resize_q90_box.jpg","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/about/","title":"About The Author"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"/geeky-blogs.netlify.app/images/author_hude9b0fa4ed50c41f999680b14b704cd9_1107719_650x0_resize_q90_box.jpg","permalink":"geeky-blogs.netlify.app/contact/","title":"Let's, Talk About You"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Privacy Policy for geeky   window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'UA-121573428-1', { 'anonymize_ip': true });    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-QSMNQ8CKJG');    Privacy Policy Last updated: November 19, 2021\nThis Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.\nWe use Your Personal data to provide and improve the Service.
